# Bloons Tower Defense
This project aims to recreate a game known as Bloons Tower Defense. The program will be interactive and act similarly to the original game. The user will be able to choose a map to play the game in. Each map will have a road for the balloons to pass through and surrounding grass to place the towers. Balloons will enter from one end of the road and continue traveling until they either reach the end of the road or are popped by surrounding towers. Each balloon that reaches the end of the road will decrease the lives of the user. When the user has no more lives and has passed all the levels, the game ends. The user will steadily earn income as time passes and can use it to purchase towers that pop the balloons.

## To-Do List
**Today's Date: 1/7/19**

- [ ] Continue working on Game class
- [ ] Figure out lanterna.jar
- [ ] Continue working on Balloon and Tile classes

    <td>Today, we created the new repository. We learned about lanterna.jar and will be spending some time trying to
    figure out how to use it. The formatting for the README.md was also finalized. </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>1/4/19</td>
    <td>Today, we worked on creating the Tile and Balloon classes, and added some methods. We decided to add a few more
    variables to our Balloon class and also to combine the Map and User classes into one big Game class.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1/5/19</td>
    <td>Today, we experimented with lanterna.jar by creating different types of modes (such as starting mode and game mode).
    We did not code anything definitive because we are still trying to understand how to use lanterna.jar. We anticipate
    this task to be one of the more challenging ones as we move forward.

<tr>
    <td>1/6/19</td>
    <td>Today, we experimented with some graphics of the game. We read in coordinates from a map file, and tried to color
    in the terminal accordingly. This task is still a work in progress. We will continue working on it tomorrow, and will
    also continue working on the Tile class.
    </td>

<tr>
    <td>1/7/19</td>
    <td>Today, we continued to experiment with the terminal graphics of the game. We started to format the graphics and achieved having two modes, one screen for starting up the game and second screen for the map of the game. The basic Tile class was finished with some additions, like the Balloon List, and we implemented it to the Game terminal. We also finished the Tower abstract class and started working on the three different towers, TackShooter, RoadSpike, and IceTower, that extend the abstract class.

<tr>
    <td>1/8/19</td>
    <td>Today, we continued writing methods for the Tile and Balloon classes. Hopefully, we will soon be able to test out their behaviors in the terminal. We are also working on features like drawing the map and setting up a timer system for the game.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1/9/19</td>
    <td>Today, we continued working on developing the graphics of the game. We attempted to implement the Balloon class in the terminal, with
    limited success. We also merged the two branches together and will modify methods over the next few days as we test them out.
